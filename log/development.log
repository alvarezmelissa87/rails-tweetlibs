After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said \"we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark.\" John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, \"user1_1\".\n\nJohn replied in his typically dismissive manner, \"You aren't even making any sense.....\" when he was suddenly startled by a noise. \"user2_1\", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction \"user2_2\". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. \"user1_2\", she whispered.\n\n\"Run!\" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of \"Run, Mandy! This way!\" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, \"Mandy?\" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.\n\nNow, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind. Suddenly a piercing cry rang out which drowned out every other sound he had ever heard. \"user2_3\", were the last words Mandy ever said. Again he was running as hard as he could. Running driven by both fear and loss. When the dagger pierced his chest it took him soom time to realize it.

It was because of the hood that she did not see the Prius heading toward her at an alarming speed. Becca heard the sound of tires on wet pavement and looked up just in time to think that she was a goner. “user1_1”, she exclaimed, putting her arms up in a defensive gesture. Moments before the car hit her, someone rushed into the street, snatching her off her feet and onto the sidewalk. \n\n“Are you alright?” The handsome stranger looked into her eyes, concern making his voice husky. The moment Becca’s eyes met his, she was lost forever. She felt heat rise up in her cheeks and became very aware of the stranger’s hands on her body. She nodded, unable to speak. “I’m Tom.” The beautiful man said. His face was also flushed. He lifted a hand to her face, caressing her cheek gently. “user2_1”, he said softly. \n\nBecca was drowning in his eyes so that she barely noticed that he wasn’t making any sense. He helped her up gently. “Forgive me,” he said, “I am overwhelmed by your beauty and find myself at a loss for words.” Becca almost swooned at that. She looked up at him, pulling him close and whispered, “user1_2”, into his ear. He smiled at her. “Will you walk with me?” Tom asked in a voice that was almost pleading. \n\nThey walked hand in hand for a while. Tom turned to Becca. “I have something I need to tell you.” He took a deep breath, “user2_2”. He cleared his throat, “Also, I’m a werewolf.” Becca gasped, her hand flying up to her mouth. “user1_3”, she exclaimed, “but I will love you always! We are meant to be. Even if that means helping you fight your nature of the beast.” Tom, tears glistening in his eyes, said, “user2_3”. Then he kissed Becca long and deep.

After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said \"we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark.\" John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, \"user1_1\".\n\nJohn replied in his typically dismissive manner, \"You aren't even making any sense.....\" when he was suddenly startled by a noise. \"user2_1\", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction \"user2_2\". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. \"user1_2\", she whispered.\n\n\"Run!\" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of \"Run, Mandy! This way!\" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, \"Mandy?\" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.\n\nNow, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind.

After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said \"we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark.\" John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, \"it's crazy and hard to understand. I am also a total noob\".\n\nJohn replied in his typically dismissive manner, \"You aren't even making any sense.....\" when he was suddenly startled by a noise. \"how do you know each other?\", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction \"RT : A day in the life of a NYC taxi\". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. \"just saw  intrigued.  If I go which tier of ticket do you recommend?\", she whispered.\n\n\"Run!\" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of \"Run, Mandy! This way!\" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, \"Mandy?\" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.\n\nNow, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind. Suddenly a piercing cry rang out which drowned out every other sound he had ever heard. \"it was middle school. I've overcome\", were the last words Mandy ever said. Again he was running as hard as he could. Running driven by both fear and loss. When the dagger pierced his chest it took him soom time to realize it. Just before he lost conciousness, the words \"\"I want to snarge\"\" bubled forth from his lips."], ["updated_at", "2014-07-20 00:40:09.667889"]]

Drakaru's second in command\nleaned forward, inspecting the engine. He folded all of his arms, his top two hands\ntucking under his armpits; the lower ones resting across his stomach. \"Visualize climate change: by 2100, New York will be as hot as Southwest Florida.

He shrugged four shoulders,\nextended his arms, and flicked out one of the two thick fingers on each of his hands.\n\n  \"How dare you treat your captain that way?!\", Drakaru said. He sidestepped Wegs, scowling at his lieutenant as he\ncircled toward the door. \"These are the last words that you're gonna hear as a free Garnok, so I'd listen up if I\nwas you. Drakaru paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. \"I don't think you are tweeting enough. and coming from me that's saying something!\"\n\n  Drakaru raised his brow and stared at Wegs, hoping his gaze would add weight to his sermon. He gripped\nWegs by one of his arms. \"You're going to the brig for saying stupid crap.\" Drakaru jerked Wegs through the door, cutting hard right and\ndisappearing into the depths of the ship as the door hissed shut.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-20 00:43:14.573327"]]

Are you just going to stand there or are you going to say something useful?\"\n\n  Wegs looked to the ceiling, scrunching his lips and then said, \"RT : Origins of the \"ching-chong\" insult can be traced through scary childhood playground taunts involving head chopping http….\"\n\n  \"What in the jumped-up-jeknar-holy-wazgurl-poop are you talking about, man?!\" Drakaru's mouth twisted as he\nraised his hands in front of him with his palms up. Wegs met Drakaru's eyes and frowned. He shrugged four shoulders,\nextended his arms, and flicked out one of the two thick fingers on each of his hands.\n\n  \"How dare you treat your captain that way?!\", Drakaru said. He sidestepped Wegs, scowling at his lieutenant as he\ncircled toward the door. \"These are the last words that you're gonna hear as a free Garnok, so I'd listen up if I\nwas you. Drakaru paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. \"RT : launched the app I've been working on the past couple months - see your personality at   via!\"\n\n  Drakaru raised his brow and stared at Wegs, hoping his gaze would add weight to his sermon. He gripped\nWegs by one of his arms. \"You're going to the brig for saying stupid crap.\" Drakaru jerked Wegs through the door, cutting hard right and\ndisappearing into the depths of the ship as the door hissed shut.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-21 22:59:02.501408"]]

After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said \"we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark.\" John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, \"No world-changing ideas tonight. Just need a combination pizza and sweatpants delivery service\".\n\nJohn replied in his typically dismissive manner, \"You aren't even making any sense.....\" when he was suddenly startled by a noise. \"What happens after you die? I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you\", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction \"I have absolutely no plan for your life\". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. \"Next time you send me an email with legal mumbo jumbo in the bottom I’ll have my lawyer review it and send you the bill\", she whispered.\n\n\"Run!\" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of \"Run, Mandy! This way!\" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, \"Mandy?\" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.\n\nNow, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind. Suddenly a piercing cry rang out which drowned out every other sound he had ever heard. \"At those darkest moments when it feels like I've abandoned you, remember: I was never with you to begin with\", were the last words Mandy ever said. Again he was running as hard as he could. Running driven by both fear and loss. When the dagger pierced his chest it took him soom time to realize it. Just before he lost conciousness, the words \"Days like today are a clear reminder that we (humans) are probably the biggest threat to our own survival\" bubbled forth from his lips.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-23 19:17:06.015352"]]

After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said \"we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark.\" John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, \"\"I want to snarge\"\".\n\nJohn replied in his typically dismissive manner, \"You aren't even making any sense.....\" when he was suddenly startled by a noise. \"RT : Origins of the \"ching-chong\" insult can be traced through scary childhood playground taunts involving head chopping http…\", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction \"If your boss tells you not to discuss your pay with coworkers, they could be breaking the law\". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. \"RT : Check out this vintage\", she whispered.\n\n\"Run!\" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of \"Run, Mandy! This way!\" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, \"Mandy?\" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.\n\nNow, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind. Suddenly a piercing cry rang out which drowned out every other sound he had ever heard. \"he misses his youth\", were the last words Mandy ever said. Again he was running as hard as he could. Running driven by both fear and loss. When the dagger pierced his chest it took him soom time to realize it. Just before he lost conciousness, the words \"My sincerest condolences. I know the pain of losing an animal companion. *big hug*\" bubbled forth from his lips.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-23 20:31:50.310893"]]

It was because of the hood that she did not see the Prius heading toward her at an alarming speed.

If I go which tier of ticket do you recommend?”, she exclaimed, putting her arms up in a defensive gesture. Moments before the car hit her, someone rushed into the street, snatching her off her feet and onto the sidewalk.\n\n“Are you alright?” The handsome stranger looked into her eyes, concern making his voice husky. The moment Becca’s eyes met his, she was lost forever. She felt heat rise up in her cheeks and became very aware of the stranger’s hands on her body. She nodded, unable to speak. “I’m Tom.” The beautiful man said. His face was also flushed. He lifted a hand to her face, caressing her cheek gently. “Visualize climate change: by 2100, New York will be as hot as Southwest Florida. Awesome D3 work”, he said softly.\n\nBecca was drowning in his eyes so that she barely noticed that he wasn’t making any sense. He helped her up gently. “Forgive me,” he said, “I am overwhelmed by your beauty and find myself at a loss for words.” Becca almost swooned at that. She looked up at him, pulling him close and whispered, “are you doing outside hacks w/sam?”, into his ear. He smiled at her. “Will you walk with me?” Tom asked in a voice that was almost pleading.\n\nThey walked hand in hand for a while. Tom turned to Becca. “I have something I need to tell you.” He took a deep breath, “\"No more put a skirt on it\" is an awesome post about gender neutral images by”. He cleared his throat, “Also, I’m a werewolf.” Becca gasped, her hand flying up to her mouth. “Check out this vintage”, she exclaimed, “but I will love you always! We are meant to be. Even if that means helping you fight your nature of the beast.” Tom, tears glistening in his eyes, said, “nope she went by heyitsdrama”. Then he kissed Becca long and deep.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-23 21:44:04.756939"]]

After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said \"we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark.\" John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, \"Didn't know about git remote groups. Push to heroku and GitHub with one command\".\n\nJohn replied in his typically dismissive manner, \"You aren't even making any sense.....\" when he was suddenly startled by a noise. \"What White Children Need to Know About Race  HT\", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction \"I wrote a blog about optimizing Images for performance \r\nThanks  for the tips\". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. \"morning lesson: bind listeners for multiple events in one line. Thank you JS\", she whispered.\n\n\"Run!\" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of \"Run, Mandy! This way!\" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, \"Mandy?\" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.\n\nNow, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind. Suddenly a piercing cry rang out which drowned out every other sound he had ever heard. \"\"ur too young to know ur gay\" said a straight parent to a gay teen\r\n\r\n\"he's such a ladies man\" said the straight person …\", were the last words Mandy ever said. Again he was running as hard as he could. Running driven by both fear and loss. When the dagger pierced his chest it took him soom time to realize it. Just before he lost conciousness, the words \"Highly recommend hackerx if you ever get an invite\" bubbled forth from his lips.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-28 23:22:03.023063"]]

It was because of the hood that she did not see the Prius heading toward her at an alarming speed. Becca heard the sound of tires on wet pavement and looked up just in time to think that she was a goner. “Why is it that the first ajax call always works right away, and the second inexplicably fails?”, she exclaimed, putting her arms up in a defensive gesture. Moments before the car hit her, someone rushed into the street, snatching her off her feet and onto the sidewalk.\n\n“Are you alright?” The handsome stranger looked into her eyes, concern making his voice husky. The moment Becca’s eyes met his, she was lost forever. She felt heat rise up in her cheeks and became very aware of the stranger’s hands on her body. She nodded, unable to speak. “I’m Tom.” The beautiful man said. His face was also flushed. He lifted a hand to her face, caressing her cheek gently. “I'm amped for Windows 8, but these are pricey tablets. Hoping the Surface is cheaper”, he said softly.\n\nBecca was drowning in his eyes so that she barely noticed that he wasn’t making any sense. He helped her up gently. “Forgive me,” he said, “I am overwhelmed by your beauty and find myself at a loss for words.” Becca almost swooned at that. She looked up at him, pulling him close and whispered, “Why do I ever try to tweak my css? Now everything is stacked on top of each other again”, into his ear. He smiled at her. “Will you walk with me?” Tom asked in a voice that was almost pleading.\n\nThey walked hand in hand for a while. Tom turned to Becca. “I have something I need to tell you.” He took a deep breath, “Cleaner, cheaper energy via the AWC”. He cleared his throat, “Also, I’m a werewolf.” Becca gasped, her hand flying up to her mouth. “are you doing outside hacks w/sam?”, she exclaimed, “but I will love you always! We are meant to be. Even if that means helping you fight your nature of the beast.” Tom, tears glistening in his eyes, said, “Your staff at SFO airport were not very sympathetic or helpful, I had to get a lady from Delta to discover YOUR mistake”. Then he kissed Becca long and deep.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-30 22:01:08.322032"]]

After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said \"we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark.\" John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, \"it would make a good vice too\".\n\nJohn replied in his typically dismissive manner, \"You aren't even making any sense.....\" when he was suddenly startled by a noise. \"I relate\", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction \"nope, I meant 72 dpi or ppi so quality, not resolution. Here is a more verbose explanation\". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. \"I didn't know you could pronounce it any other way\", she whispered.\n\n\"Run!\" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of \"Run, Mandy! This way!\" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, \"Mandy?\" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.\n\nNow, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind. Suddenly a piercing cry rang out which drowned out every other sound he had ever heard. \"DevShop COO  just wrote an awesome blog on 's blog about what it takes to get hired (at least at Devshop)\", were the last words Mandy ever said. Again he was running as hard as he could. Running driven by both fear and loss. When the dagger pierced his chest it took him soom time to realize it. Just before he lost conciousness, the words \"if only I had known about generators when I was working on my final\" bubbled forth from his lips.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-30 22:25:23.299032"]]

It was because of the hood that she did not see the Prius heading toward her at an alarming speed. Becca heard the sound of tires on wet pavement and looked up just in time to think that she was a goner. “googling isn't that art of finding answers, but the art of question development”, she exclaimed, putting her arms up in a defensive gesture. Moments before the car hit her, someone rushed into the street, snatching her off her feet and onto the sidewalk.\n\n“Are you alright?” The handsome stranger looked into her eyes, concern making his voice husky. The moment Becca’s eyes met his, she was lost forever. She felt heat rise up in her cheeks and became very aware of the stranger’s hands on her body. She nodded, unable to speak. “I’m Tom.” The beautiful man said. His face was also flushed. He lifted a hand to her face, caressing her cheek gently. “YO! Impress all ur homies &amp; stay straight stuntin by learning deez lyrics to keep ur party trill:   💅”, he said softly.\n\nBecca was drowning in his eyes so that she barely noticed that he wasn’t making any sense. He helped her up gently. “Forgive me,” he said, “I am overwhelmed by your beauty and find myself at a loss for words.” Becca almost swooned at that. She looked up at him, pulling him close and whispered, “are you doing outside hacks w/sam?”, into his ear. He smiled at her. “Will you walk with me?” Tom asked in a voice that was almost pleading.\n\nThey walked hand in hand for a while. Tom turned to Becca. “I have something I need to tell you.” He took a deep breath, “THE VIDEO 7.31.14 💅”. He cleared his throat, “Also, I’m a werewolf.” Becca gasped, her hand flying up to her mouth. “thanks for the node help. had to run to make the next lecture. I learned a lot”, she exclaimed, “but I will love you always! We are meant to be. Even if that means helping you fight your nature of the beast.” Tom, tears glistening in his eyes, said, “OMG hashtag typo 🙍”.

After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said \"we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark.\" John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, \"Why is it that the first ajax call always works right away, and the second inexplicably fails?\".\n\nJohn replied in his typically dismissive manner, \"You aren't even making any sense.....\" when he was suddenly startled by a noise. \"nope, I meant 72 dpi or ppi so quality, not resolution. Here is a more verbose explanation\", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction \"here's another explanation\". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. \"thanks for the node help. had to run to make the next lecture. I learned a lot\", she whispered.\n\n\"Run!\" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of \"Run, Mandy! This way!\" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, \"Mandy?\" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.\n\nNow, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind. Suddenly a piercing cry rang out which drowned out every other sound he had ever heard. \"I wrote a blog about optimizing Images for performance \r\nThanks  for the tips\", were the last words Mandy ever said. Again he was running as hard as he could. Running driven by both fear and loss. When the dagger pierced his chest it took him soom time to realize it. Just before he lost conciousness, the words \"This may mean the end of pair programming for me. Now I can pair with myself\" bubbled forth from his lips.\n"], ["updated_at", "2014-07-30 23:53:12.422872"]]
